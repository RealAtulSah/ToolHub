## 🚀 Running Locally

Because the project uses ES6 Javascript Modules (`type="module"`), opening the files directly in a browser via the file protocol (`file:///...`) will trigger browser CORS restrictions. You must run a local HTTP server:

### Option 1: Python (Built-in)
Run the following command in the project root:
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

### Option 2: Node.js (http-server)
Run using npx:
```bash
npx http-server -p 8000
```
Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

ToolHub Pro does not collect, log, or transmit any user files or text inputs. Everything is compiled and processed locally in your browser memory:
- **No Analytics Tracking:** We don't track your tools usage.
- **No Server Infrastructure:** The site is hosted statically and functions entirely in sandbox mode on client resources.
- **Immediate Resource Cleanup:** Files loaded for conversion are released from memory as soon as the browser tab is closed.
